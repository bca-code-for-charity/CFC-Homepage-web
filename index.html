            Welcome to CodeForCharity! We are a community of high school coders, thinkers, artists, and engineers based
            in Bergen County, New Jersey. Together, our mission is to help out charities and all sorts of nonprofit
            organizations and communities establish an online presence in the modern digital world. We help out with
            creating websites, web and mobile applications for any organizations that need help in those areas. Feel
            free to look at our project archive to see some of the projects that we've worked on in the past, or our
            active projects page to take a look at the projects we are currently working on or planning to start working
            on in the near future. All of our project code is open source.
